# GuessTheNumberGame
This code implements a "Guess the Number" game in Java, where the user has to guess a random number generated by the program. The program uses a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented with Java Swing to display the game and interact with the user. 

The game starts by generating a random number between a minimum and a maximum value. The program displays a label with the range of numbers the user should guess between, a text field for the user to enter their guess, and two buttons to submit a guess or start a new game. 

When the user submits a guess, the program checks whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low, and provides feedback to the user. Additionally, the program uses an artificial intelligence (AI) component to make a guess based on the feedback the user has provided. The AI component uses a simple binary search algorithm to narrow down the range of possible numbers until it finds the correct answer. 

If the user or the AI guesses the correct number, the program indicates that the game is over and allows the user to start a new game.
